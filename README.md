# Simple Crud for Web Programming Lecture Esa Unggul University 2024
## For Regular Tangerang's Campus Student
If you already have the same structure directory for Web Programming Lecture from Mr. Sunupurwa's (often called 'Pak Jefry') repo of [Web Programming](https://github.com/djambred/pemrograman_web/tree/main/tugas) and using ```tugas``` directory just refer my src folder or directory (the place for Laravel source code). Any update of this repo, if you still keep it separately from any dir that already have working git on it, just do :
```bash 
git pull
``` 

If you lazy enough, to download it you can either do by git clone my repo to new folder, move or copy my src to your intended directory then just remove the rest of my clonned repo.
